        <h1>A Place to visit Overseas</h1>

        <img src="images/goldcoast.jpg" alt="Gold Coast, Australia" width="35%" border="5px" style="float: left;">

        <p>A place I'd like to visit is the Gold Coast in Australia. (Other than New Zealand, of course), it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. It has a lot of Touristy destinations such as beaches, theme parks (Dreamworld, Sea World etc), and the fact that it has many parks, like the Tamborine National Park not too far away from the metropolitan area. This park has activities like eco adventures, rainforest canopy walks and educational opportunities. This, plus over 21,000 hectares of rainforests to explore.</p>

        <p>The Gold Coast also offers Whale Watching Cruises. Sea World offers this ability, which includes a 100% whale sighting guarantee. On board, there will be a professional photographer, a full licensed onboard bar, audio and visual presentations and an educational activity book for your kids.</p>

        <p>That, is unfortunately, quite expensive. So luckily, you can still find things to do if you cant quite afford to spend your life savings away in the Gold Coast. Swimming at one of the stunning beaches is free, and the chances of being a victim of a shark attack is extremely rare. Popular beach options are Burleigh, Kurruwa and Coolangatta. Its fun, safe and free. Just be sure to keep between the red and yellow flags to ensure your safety (this way the lifeguards can keep an eye on you if anything does go south). Or, if you still don't like the idea of a shark attack, there is a protected swimming enclosure in Southport, opposite the Australia Fair in Marine Parade. You won't have to worry about waves or wildlife there.</p>

        <p>There's also the free option of the Currumbin Valley - the Currumbin Rock Pools, which is not far from the Currumbin Beach. It's fresh water rock pools and a streaming creak, making it a perfect area for a family day out. It comes equipt with picnic tables, shelter, river banks, barbeques, and definitely plenty of space for the kids to run around. And from the picnic area, there's a 1.6km walking trail through the Mount Cougal National Park, so you can fully explore Currumbin Valley. I don't think you'd get bored of this place for a while.</p>

        <br><br>

        <img src="images/market.jpg" alt="Gold Coast, Australia" width="40%" border="5px" style="float: right;">

        <p>If you want to visit markets, then The Gold Coast has those too. One such market is the Arts & Crafts Market. They're definitely colourful, and they have over 150 store owners selling wonderful gifts, souvenirs, local art, jewellery and more. The market changes beachsides, working their way down from Broadbeach to Burleigh Heads then to Coolangatta. You can shop in the markets and the go for a swim in the lovely ocean beach water. They've been running for 20 years and are definitely always a hit with visitors that want to cop themselves something a little different.</p>

        <p>Other market options include a Chinatown Street Market that serves authentic Asian food and experience.The Surfers Paradise Beachfront Market that is a great way to shop and enjoy the sea breezes that stem from the Surfers Paradise Beach. The Esplanade along the beach becomes a hive of activity with colourful stalls beginning to set up for the twilight markets. This market ensures the 100 stalls included sell quality local, handmade and homegrown products. A simple stroll by the beach suring this time will yield you unique gifts, fashion, jewellery, art, photographs, beauty products and homewares.</p>

        <p>The Village Markets has become a favourite with the kids. It's an open air market that sells unique art and fashion. This market nurtures emerging fashion designers, vintage collects, jewellery designers, artists and the crafty by giving them a space to sell their goods. Market goers get a brilliant day out with friends, talking with the designers and artists about their wares, listen to live music and enjoy gourmet food and drinks too.</p>

        <p>Other markets include the Carrara Market that are enormously popular with locals and tourist that are looking for a bargain. With 500 stalls offering beauty products, tools, shows, fishing gear, candles, plants, toys and even a tattoo studio, there truly is something for everyone. The market opens nice and early, serving breakfast and then later in the day you can have fresh donuts, soft drinks, beer and fresh food to take home for dinner. Kids get offered face painting, pony riding, a merry-go-round and an animal farm while you can go and shop without them. These markets even offer a courtesy bus which only costs $1 for pick up and return. Admission is free, so it really is a cheap, fun way to spend your time.</p>
